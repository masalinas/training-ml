# A Boutique car manufacture (Resource problem)

We’re consulting for a boutique car manufacturer, producing luxury cars. They run on one month (30 days) cycles, we have one cycle to show we can provide value.

They run on one month (30 days) cycles, we have one cycle to show we can provide value.

The 2 cars need different time with each resource:

Stuff | A | B 
----- | --- | ---
Robot time | 3  | 4
Engineering time| 5 | 6
Detailer time | 1,5 | 34

Car A provides €30,000 profit, whilst Car B offers €45,000 profit.

At the moment, they produce 4 of each cars per month, for €300,000 profit. Not bad at all, but we think we can do better for them.
