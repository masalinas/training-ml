# A Sausage manufacture (Blending problem)

We’re going to make some sausages!

We have the following ingredients available to us:

Ingredients | Cost (e/Kg) | Available (Kg) 
----- | --- | ---
Pork | 4.22  | 30
Wheat | 2.46 | 20
Starch | 1.86 | 17

We’ll make 2 types of sausage:

- Economy (>40% Pork)
- Premium (>60% Pork)

One sausage is 50 grams (0.05 kg)

According to government regulations, the most starch we can use in our sausages is 25%

We have a contract with a butcher, and have already purchased 23 kg pork, that must go in our sausages.

We have a demand for 350 economy sausages and 500 premium sausages.

We need to figure out how to most cost effectively blend our sausages.
