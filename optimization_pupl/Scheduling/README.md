# A Scheduming model

We have 2 offshore production plants in 2 locations and an estimated demand for our products

We want to produce a schedule of production from both plants that meets our demand with the lowest cost.

A factory can be in 2 states:

Off – Producing zero units
On – Producing between its minimum and maximum production capacities

Both factories have fixed costs, that are incurred as long as the factory is on, and variable costs, a cost per unit of production. These vary month by month.

We also know that factory B is down for maintenance in month 5.
